Unity Font Replacer

# About
This is a little tool I made to make replacing fonts in a Unity scene easier. 

Simply attach the "FontReplacer" script to the parent of the text objects you'd like to replace the fonts of.

This will usually be a canvas object but it doesn't have to be.
Then add the font you'd like to replace and press either the "Replace all in scene" or "Replace all children" button and the appropriate fonts will be changed.


You can also have specific text objects ignored by attaching the "FontReplacementIgnore" script to the object.


If you'd like a prepacked verison of this tool you can [download it here.](https://magicnanners.itch.io/unity-font-replacer)


Please let me know if you have any issues. Enjoy!
